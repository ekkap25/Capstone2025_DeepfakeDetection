# Capstone2025 – Deepfake Detection

Source code for my MSc ACS Capstone.  
Key folders:
- `blink detection/` – EAR-based blink detector (rule-based).
- `code/` – Colab notebooks (training/eval).
- `gradcam results/` – Grad-CAM images.
- `models/` – small saved models (`.keras`) for quick testing.
- `samples/` – a few test files (no licensed datasets).
- `training logs/` – accuracy/loss plots and logs.

**Datasets:** Not included (license/size). Please download from official sources (e.g., FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, DFDC) and place under a local `dataset/` directory if retraining.

**Environment:** see `requirements.txt`.
